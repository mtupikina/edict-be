# No Lint Errors

- **Lint must pass:** All code must satisfy the project's ESLint rules. No lint errors or warnings are allowed.
- **Before committing:** Run `npm run lint` and fix any reported issues. **Code cannot be committed** until lint is without errors (see commit-gate-tests-and-lint).
- **CI:** Lint should be part of the CI pipeline; the build should fail if lint fails.
- When adding or changing code, ensure new code follows existing lint rules (e.g. avoid `any`, remove unused imports). **Unused variables and parameters are not allowed;** prefix with `_` only when the parameter is required by a signature but intentionally unused (e.g. `_accessToken`).
